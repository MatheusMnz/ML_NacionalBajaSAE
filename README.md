# Machine Learning Challenge - BAJA-SAE

This project was proposed by the SAE Organization. We were provided with a large dataset containing information about various cars that participated in previous editions of the competition. The challenge involved analyzing the data, preprocessing it, proposing a machine learning model, and predicting classification groups in which the vehicle of our team would be classified in the actual competition.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3 or higher)
- Pip (Python package manager)

To run this code, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install these libraries easily using pip. Here's an example of how to install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MatheusMnz/ML_NacionalBajaSAE.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
* On Windows
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* On Linux and MacOS
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Run the Python code:
   ```bash
   python3 bajaML.py
   ```
